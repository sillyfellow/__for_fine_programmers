pffp: Problems for fine programmers
===================================

In the summers of 2009 and 2010, I offered a course (Python for fine Programmers) at the department of Computer Science, at Technical University Munich.

Over the past few years, I have lost/misplaced the solutions/programs to many of the problems I had given as weekly exercises. I try to quickly go through the list, and write down the solutions here.

1. Write three different functions, each of which gives the fibonacci number correspondin to the input number. (iterative, recursive & memoized recursive)
   Bonus: Write a 4th and better function (matrix multiplication)

   a. Python - https://github.com/sillyfellow/pffp/blob/master/python/fib.py

2. Write a program to find out the square root of a given number. (Without the help of python math library). (think of binary search)
   Bonus: Extend this to nth root.

   a. Python - https://github.com/sillyfellow/pffp/blob/master/python/nth_root.py

3. Write a program, without using the int function of python, to convert a string (representing an integer) to the integer.
   Also, do the reverse: Integer to String
   Bonus: Extend this to floating points
   
   a. Python - https://github.com/sillyfellow/pffp/blob/master/python/atoitoa.py

4. Write a program to generate all the combinations of all the characters in a given string,
   or a list of characters
